Step 1: Install using npm (Recommended for Node.js Users) 
If you have Node.js and npm installed, you can install Sass with a single command. This is the most common method in modern web development. 
Ensure Node.js and npm are installed. You can check this by running the following commands in your terminal:
bash
node -v
npm -v
Use code with caution.

If they are not installed, download them from the official Node.js website.
Install Sass globally using the following command in your terminal:
bash
npm install -g sass
Use code with caution.

The -g flag ensures it's available from any directory on your system. 


Step 2: Standalone Installation
This method does not require Node.js or any other external dependencies. 
Download the package for your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux) from the official Sass GitHub releases page.
Extract the archive to a location on your computer.
Add the directory containing the sass executable to your system's PATH environment variable. This allows you to run the sass command from any terminal window. The specific steps for adding to the PATH will vary slightly by operating system.


Step 3: Install using Homebrew (macOS and Linux)
If you are a macOS or Linux user and have the Homebrew package manager installed, you can install Sass easily:
Open your terminal.
Run the following command:
bash
brew install sass/sass/sass
Use code with caution.

Verify Installation
After using any of the methods above, open a new terminal window and verify the installation by checking the Sass version:
bash
sass --version
Use code with caution.
